# Phase Two Project

This is a Data Science phase 2 project, Contributed equally by Limo Dennis, Ronoh Peter, Osoro Delvin, Thuo Boniface and Gitau Joy.

## Project Overview
This project aims to use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder who is interested in creating a new movie studio and requires data insights to help decide what type of films to create.

## Business Problem

A company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Data
In the folder `Data` in this repository are movie datasets from:

- [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
- [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
- [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
- [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

That we used. Because the data was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or pd.read_csv, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
In this section, we performed the following EDA activities; 

- Data Understanding: we previewed the sets of data to understand the structure and nature of the data, including the types of variables and the relationships between them.

- Descriptive Statistics: we calculated the summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles to get a sense of the data distribution.

- Data Visualization: We created the following visualizations; Scatter plots, Line plots, Bar charts and Heatmaps which we used to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.

- Correlation Analysis: We Investigated the relationships between variables and helped to identify potential relationships.

- Data Modelling: We used the insights gained from EDA to inform the creation of new features that may improve model performance.
