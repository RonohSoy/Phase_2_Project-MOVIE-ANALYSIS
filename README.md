# Phase Two Project

This is a Data Science phase 2 project, contributed equally by [Limo Dennis](https://github.com/ShemDennis), [Ronoh Peter](https://github.com/RonohSoy), [Osoro Delvin](https://github.com/Delvinah), [Thuo Boniface](https://github.com/Boninafethuo) and [Gitau Joy](https://github.com/Mweru).

## Project Overview
This project aims to use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder who is interested in creating a new movie studio and requires data insights to help decide what type of films to create.

## Business Problem

A company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Data
In the folder `Data` in this repository are movie datasets from:

- [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
- [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
- [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
- [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Because the data was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or pd.read_csv, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.
In this project we used the `tmdb.movies.csv`, `tn.movie_budgets.csv` and `im.db`

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
In this section, we performed the following EDA activities; 

- Data Understanding: we previewed the sets of data to understand the structure and nature of the data, including the types of variables and the relationships between them.

- Descriptive Statistics: we calculated the summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles to get a sense of the data distribution.

- Data Visualization: We created the following visualizations; Scatter plots, Line plots, Bar charts and Heatmaps which we used to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.

- Correlation Analysis: We Investigated the relationships between variables and helped to identify potential relationships.

- Data Modelling: We used the insights gained from EDA to inform the creation of new features that may improve model performance.
    
## Key Findings

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The 3 main recommendations based on our analysis findings are that the company should;
1.Invest in High Budgets: We established that high budget films have high returns.
2. Focus on Popular Genres: From our data, the highly rated genres were the Drama and Documentary genres.
3. Boost Marketing for Popularity: We identified that high popularity increases the rate of box office performance.

In summary, in film production, the higher the movie rating the higher the popularity at box office and higher returns which increases with the higher the production budget.


## Additional Information and resources
We heavily relied on our [Moringa school](https://moringaschool.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIltKThaO0iQMVSJmDBx0ouiIhEAAYASAAEgKf5PD_BwE) class content and Labs when doing this project.
